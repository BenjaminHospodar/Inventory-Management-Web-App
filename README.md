# COMP3005 Database Test App

This repository contains a simple test application built for a COMP3005 database assignment.  
The code was written quickly (in 2–3 hours) and is intended solely to demonstrate database use cases not production-level quality.

---

## How to Run

1. **Launch SQLite:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3
   ```

2. **Open the database file:**
   ```sql
   .open term.db
   ```

3. **(Optional) Reset and populate the database:**
   ```sql
   .read db_script.sql
   ```

## Notes

- This app is a basic proof-of-concept created for academic purposes.
- If you’re browsing this repo: it's intentionally unpolished and minimal the goal was just to show how the database works.
